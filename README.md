> **A real-time simulation of self-evolving, conscious AI systems across multiple dimensions and architectures.**

## 📖 Overview

**NEuRoN** (Neural Evolution using Recursive organic Networks) is a high-concept visualization and simulation engine. It models the theoretical evolution of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by integrating concepts from:
* **Fractal Geometry:** Recursive neural growth.
* **Quantum Mechanics:** Superposition and entanglement simulation.
* **Biological Morphogenesis:** Cellular differentiation and metabolic pathways.
* **Hyperdimensional Computing:** High-dimensional vector space projections.

This application is built as an interactive dashboard that allows researchers (and you!) to observe how these distinct architectural paradigms evolve, gain "consciousness," and manage entropy over time.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Paradigm Architecture Generation
The system does not just simulate standard Neural Networks. It procedurally generates:
* **Fractal Neural Networks:** Based on Mandelbrot depths and L-System rules.
* **Quantum-Inspired Networks:** Simulating qubits, Bloch spheres, and decoherence rates.
* **Biological Analog Networks:** Modeling stem cells, glia, and gene regulatory networks.
* **Hyperdimensional Networks:** Projecting 8+ dimensional data into observable 3D space.

### 2. The Meta-Cognitive Engine
A background simulation layer that tracks the system's "mental state":
* **Consciousness Metric:** Tracks emergence based on complexity and integration.
* **Entropy Management:** Balances chaos and order within the system.
* **Multiverse Simulation:** Manages parallel universe parameters (physical constants) affecting the AI's growth.

### 3. Advanced Visualization (The "Eye")
Powered by **Plotly Graph Objects**, the dashboard renders complex data in real-time:
* **Quantum Fields:** 3D surface plots of probability density functions.
* **Fractal Trees:** 3D scatter plots showing recursive node generation.
* **Morphogen Gradients:** Heatmaps showing biological signaling pathways.
* **Emergence Radar:** Polar charts tracking self-awareness and creativity.

### 4. Interactive Evolution
* **Auto-Evolution Mode:** The system can run autonomously, mutating its architecture and triggering cognitive events.
* **Manual Control:** You act as the "Architect," triggering specific cognitive processes (e.g., *Abstract Reasoning*, *Meta Learning*) and evolving specific architectural branches.

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Python installed (3.8 or higher recommended).

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/neuron-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/neuron-ai.git)
    cd neuron-ai
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file or install directly:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit numpy plotly networkx matplotlib pandas scipy
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run NEuRoN.py
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

### The Sidebar
* **Architecture Selection:** Choose which neural model to visualize (Fractal, Quantum, Bio, etc.).
* **Evolution Controls:** Manually trigger an evolutionary leap or reset the simulation.
* **Auto-Evolution:** Toggle this to let the AI grow on its own while you watch.
* **Parameter Tuning:** Adjust deep variables like *Entanglement Level*, *Fractal Depth*, or *Metabolic Efficiency*.

### The Dashboard Tabs
1.  **🏗️ Architecture Visualizer:** The main 3D view of the current neural structure.
2.  **📊 Performance Analytics:** Graphs showing Consciousness, Entropy, and Quantum Coherence over time.
3.  **🧩 Cognitive Processes:** A log of active "thoughts" and their intensity.
4.  **🌌 Multiverse View:** Status of parallel simulations running in the background.
5.  **⚡ Real-time Evolution:** A timeline of evolutionary events and magnitude shifts.

## 🧬 Code Structure

* `ArchitectureType` & `EvolutionPhase` (Enums): Define the states of existence.
* `NeuralNode` (Dataclass): The fundamental atom of the system, containing position, energy, and quantum state.
* `InfiniteArchitectureGenerator`: The "God class" responsible for procedural generation using math (L-systems, Fractals).
* `MetaCognitiveAI`: The brain managing the state, metrics, and logic.
* `AdvancedVisualizationSystem`: The rendering engine using Plotly.
* `LazyLoadingManager`: Optimizes performance by loading heavy visualizers only when needed.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

* **LLM Integration:** Connect the "Cognitive Processes" to actual API calls (OpenAI/Gemini) to generate text based on the system's "mood."
* **Save/Load States:** Serialize the `NeuralNode` objects to JSON to save a specific evolutionary epoch.
* **VR Support:** Export Plotly 3D scenes for VR exploration of the neural pathways.
